Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is  the  genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain  diseases  because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However  ,  for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagonosed out with  a  certain genetic disease , are we  supposed  to disclose this result to our relatives ?
